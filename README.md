# Piano

In november 2018 I started taking piano lessons from [Dmytro Sukhovienko](https://www.dmytro.net/). In this repository I'm going to keep track of my progress. Feel free to follow along!

## Current repertoire

1. [Chopin: Prelude Op. 28 No. 4 (E minor)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90wBhBZjAUQ)
2. [Mozart: Rondo Alla Turca (A major)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_THdzBnHy0)

5. [Rachmaninov: Morceau de fantaisie (G minor)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8KIhwVFxGI)

## Current practice routine

1. Play C major scale
2. Play C major arpeggio
3. Play A minor harmonic scale
4. Play A minor melodic scale
5. Play A minor arpeggio
6. Play E major scale
7. Play E major arpeggio
8. Play G major scale
9. Play G major arpeggio
10. Play A major scale
11. Play A major arpeggio
12. Work on piece(s)

## Tips

* Practice every day you can, even if it's just playing scales or a piece you already know
* Always try to sing melodies to know where to slow down (like taking a breath)
* Try sightreading new material every day, preferably material you don't know by ear
* Scales and arpeggios are important, practice them every day
* Every sign on sheet music is important, read carefully
* Play a measure over and over until you nail it, go the next one and repeat, then practice the transitions between measures
