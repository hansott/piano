## 💡 Tips

* Practice every day you can, even if it's just playing scales or a piece you already know
* Always try to sing melodies to know where to slow down (like taking a breath)
* Try sightreading new material every day, preferably material you don't know by ear
* Scales and arpeggios are important, practice them every day
* Every sign on sheet music is important, read carefully
* Play a measure over and over until you nail it, go the next one and repeat, then practice the transitions between measures
* Practice the right notes, don't think you'll refine it later. Do it right from the first time. Go slow, really! Use a metronome. When performing, the tempo should be right on the edge of falling apart
* Practice the hard parts first, in order to discover the tempo that's possible
* Do research on the composer of the piece you're learning. You should listen to pieces that are not solo piano. e.g. For Mozart, you can listen to his requiem. Those works will help you understand the composer.

## 🎯 Pieces I hope to play some day

1. [Rachmaninoff: Prelude Op. 23 No. 5 (G minor)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9idfQVkqKyw)

I discovered this piece several years ago. Even after hearing it more than a [~100 times](https://www.last.fm/user/hansott/library/tracks), I can't get enough of it. The middle section is so beautiful.

2. [Rachmaninoff: Etude-Tableaux Op. 33 No. 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDjKAySWrkU)
3. [Rachmaninoff: Elegie Op.1 No. 3 (Eb minor)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx3ZTAQ6boo)
4. [Franz Liszt: Liebestraum No. 3 (Ab major)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InKk1aowFZ4)
